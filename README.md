# ECOFUND

## EcoFund (as in: Decentralized Fundraisers) is a decentralized platform for fundraising of all Environmental problem & solutions. As any dApp, it runs on blockchain and ensures full automation, security, transparency and fairness.

### EcoFund currently supports two types of fundraisers:
  **1. One-time fundraiser** where the organizer describes the goal of the fundraiser and optional the goal amount (in USD) and end date. Donors may choose to fund a one-time fundraiser as long as it's in open status and they have funds in their wallet.
  
  **2. recurring fundraiser** where donors may pledge to donate a set amount at a given interval - this can be used for all kinds of cyclical donations.
  
  ## EcoFund relies on the following technologies:
   * **Chainlink price feeds** are used to securely convert donations made in crypto to fiat goals, e.g. ETH â†’ USD.
   * **Chainlink Keepers** are used to automate recurring payments made from donors to fundraisers.
   * **Moralis** is used for smooth web3 experience.
   * **Web3.Storage powered by Filecoin** is used to store fundraiser descriptions and images in a decentralized manner without the cost of on-chain storage.
