# ECOFUND

### EcoFund (as in: Decentralized Fundraisers) is a decentralized platform for fundraising of all Environmental problem & solutions. As any dApp, it runs on blockchain and ensures full automation, security, transparency and fairness.

### EcoFund currently supports two types of fundraisers:
     ### **One-time fundraiser** where the organizer describes the goal of the fundraiser and optional the goal amount (in USD) and end date. Donors may choose to fund a one-time fundraiser as long as it's in open status and they have funds in their wallet.
